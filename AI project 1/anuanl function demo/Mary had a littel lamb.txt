Mary owned a fluffy lamb,
White as winter's snowy land.
Everywhere she'd go, it'd roam,
A loyal friend, a gentle home.

To school one day, the lamb did stray,
A curious sight, a playful fray.
Children laughed, a joyful sound,
As fluffy friend was gently bound.

The teacher shooed, a stern command,
But still, the lamb did softly stand.
Awaiting Mary's kind embrace,
A bond of love, a tender grace.
