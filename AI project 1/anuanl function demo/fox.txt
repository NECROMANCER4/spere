Once upon a time, a sly fox roamed through a vineyard, his nose twitching with the sweet scent of ripe grapes. High up on the vine, clusters of juicy, purple grapes hung, tempting the hungry fox. He leaped and stretched, but the grapes were just out of reach.

Try as he might, the fox couldn't quite grasp the delicious fruit. Frustrated and exhausted, he finally gave up. As he walked away, he muttered to himself, "Those grapes are probably sour anyway. I wouldn't want them."

With this, the fox sauntered off, pretending to be indifferent to the very grapes he had so desperately desired.
